## Overview

The Algorithm Visualizer is a tool designed to help users understand and visualize various algorithms. It provides graphical representations of different algorithms, making it easier to grasp their concepts and workings.

## Features

- **Interactive Graphs**: Visualize algorithms with interactive graphs.
- **Multiple Time Complexities**: View different time complexities such as O(n), O(n^2), O(log n), etc.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for selecting and visualizing algorithms.
- **Educational Tool**: Ideal for students and educators to learn and teach algorithms.

## How to Use

1. **Select an Algorithm**: Choose an algorithm from the list.
2. **Adjust Parameters**: Use the sliders to adjust input sizes and other parameters.
3. **Visualize**: Click on the visualize button to see the algorithm in action.
4. **Analyze**: Study the graphical representation and understand the algorithm's behavior.
